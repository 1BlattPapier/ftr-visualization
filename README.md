## How to use
Clicking on a bar from one of the bar charts filters for the selected topic or emotion. Shift-clicking can be used to select multiple bars. Double-clicking or clicking inside the chart but outside of the bars resets the selection.

Note that sentences with multiple topics are highlighted differently depending on the amount of their topics or emotions being highlighted.
